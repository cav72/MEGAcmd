### masterkey
Shows your master key.

Usage: `masterkey pathtosave`
<pre>
Your data is only readable through a chain of decryption operations that begins
with your master encryption key (Recovery Key), which MEGA stores encrypted with your password.
This means that if you lose your password, your Recovery Key can no longer be decrypted,
and you can no longer decrypt your data.
Exporting the Recovery Key and keeping it in a secure location
enables you to set a new password without data loss.
Always keep physical control of your master key (e.g. on a client device, external storage, or print)
