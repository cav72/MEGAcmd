### webdav
Configures a WEBDAV server to serve a location in MEGA

Usage: `webdav [-d (--all | remotepath ) ] [ remotepath [--port=PORT] [--public] [--tls --certificate=/path/to/certificate.pem --key=/path/to/certificate.key]] [--use-pcre]`
<pre>
This can also be used for streaming files. The server will be running as long as MEGAcmd Server is.
If no argument is given, it will list the webdav enabled locations.

Options:
 --d        	Stops serving that location
 --all      	When used with -d, stops serving all locations (and stops the server)
 --public   	*Allow access from outside localhost
 --port=PORT	*Port to serve. DEFAULT= 4443
 --tls      	*Serve with TLS (HTTPS)
 --certificate=/path/to/certificate.pem	*Path to PEM formated certificate
 --key=/path/to/certificate.key	*Path to PEM formated key
 --use-pcre	use PCRE expressions

*If you serve more than one location, these parameters will be ignored and use those of the first location served.
 If you want to change those parameters, you need to stop serving all locations and configure them again.

Caveat: This functionality is in BETA state. It might not be available on all platforms. If you experience any issue with this, please contact: support@mega.nz
