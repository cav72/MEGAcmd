### graphics
Shows if special features related to images and videos are enabled.

Usage: `graphics [on|off]`
<pre>
Use "graphics on/off" to enable/disable it.

Disabling these features will avoid the upload of previews and thumbnails
for images and videos.

It's only recommended to disable these features before uploading files
with image or video extensions that are not really images or videos,
or that are encrypted in the local drive so they can't be analyzed anyway.

Notice that this setting will be saved for the next time you open MEGAcmd
</pre>
